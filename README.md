# SCBench

The SCBench benchmark suite has been developed for SystemC verification and validation. The designs included in the suite are selected from a wide variety of applications domains. Key features of SCBench are described as follows.

1. SCBench consists of 38 well-written representive SystemC designs from various application domains, such as CPU architecutre, security, DSP, image processing, network, and telecommunication.
2. The designs range from small single process designs to large multi-process designs. All designs are selected carefully to cover as many SystemC features as possible.
3. Each design has been provided a set of stimuli and a testbench including stimuli applications and output monitors.
4. SCBench is freely available online to all researchers.
